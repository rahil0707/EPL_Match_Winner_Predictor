# EPL_Match_Winner_Predictor
Machine learning model that predicts football match winners using Machine Learning And Python

* Trained a machine learning model that can predict whether a team will win a given match in the EPL or not using machine learning and Python
* Cleaned match data for the 2020-2021 and 2021-2022 EPL seasons that was loaded into pandas, data was obtained through web scraping and loaded into a csv file.
* Applied the Random Forest Classifier (because of its ability to pick up non linear tendencies) machine learning model, and it predicted which team will win a match based on predictors and a target.
* Measured the accuracy of the algorithm and improved the performance/precision using rolling averages and more predictors.
